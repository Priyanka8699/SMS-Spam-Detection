6. Model Results & Interpretation
Naive Bayes Model:

Achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set.

Precision: X%, Recall: X%, F1-score: X%.

Explanation: Naive Bayes uses word frequency to model spam/non-spam probability. It assumes feature independence, which might not always be true but works well for text classification.

Neural Networks with Custom Embeddings:

Achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set.

Precision: X%, Recall: X%, F1-score: X%.

Explanation: This model learns word embeddings and captures sequential dependencies using LSTM layers. It's flexible and models complex relationships but requires more computational power.

Bidirectional LSTM Model:

Achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set.

Precision: X%, Recall: X%, F1-score: X%.

Explanation: Bidirectional LSTM processes input sequences in both directions, effectively capturing long-term dependencies. It’s well-suited for sequential data but requires more training data and resources.

Transfer Learning with Universal Sentence Encoder:

Achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set.

Precision: X%, Recall: X%, F1-score: X%.

Explanation: This model uses pre-trained embeddings to capture semantic meaning, allowing effective classification with limited data. It’s a robust approach for text classification, especially with specific or small datasets.

7. Comparing Models
Accuracy: Identifying the most accurate model.

Precision-Recall: Understanding the trade-off between identifying spam correctly and minimizing false positives.

F1-score: Comparing overall performance in terms of precision and recall.

8. Conclusion
The SMS Spam Detection project provides a comprehensive framework for text analysis and model building, focusing on spam detection. Users can utilize this project to understand, preprocess, model, and evaluate text data, enhancing their text classification skills and improving spam detection systems.
